<h1><a id="controls">Controls List</a></h1>
<p>This is a reference list of controls, with brief descriptions. The controls list is divided into management controls and gameplay controls.

<h1><a id="loadingandsaving">Loading And Saving Crosswords</a></h1>
<p>With the program running, you can hit L to open the list of crossword files. Use the up and down arrow keys to move through the list of files. When you have the found your selected crossword, hit Return
or Enter to load the file. Once the file is loaded, you can move onto immediately solving it. Alternatively, before loading the file you can hit Escape to close the loading dialog, and continue to use the program.</p>

<p>You can hit L at any time to re-open the list of crossword files. Remember that if you want to save (see below) your progress on an existing open crossword, you must do so before loading a new crossword.</p>

<p>You can hit S to save the currently open crossword. The crossword file is automatically saved with the title of the current crossword. If a crossword file of the same name already exists, then the crossword is saved
 using the crossword title followed by an underscore followed by a number.</p>
 
<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="navigatingtable">Navigating the Clues Table</a></h1>
<p>You can use the arrow keys to navigate the clues table. The table has the following columns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Date - CalendarPuzzles crosswords have a clue for each day, and so are numbered by date. Some puzzles even have solutions that are in alphabetical order of the date.</li>
	<li>Guess - Your guess at the answer to the clue.</li>
	<li>Clue - The clue that you must solve.</li>
	<li>Solution Structure - The structure of the solution - the length of words in an answer, and the puncutation that comes in between those words.</li>
	<li>Entry Name - Each clue entry name consists of the numbers and directions that the clue takes. Some clues snake around the grids, and so can take multiple numbers and directions!</li>
</ul>

<p>The voice will read out details of clues as you go navigate through the table. You can use the left and right arrow keys to read different columns of the clues table.</p>

<p>It is possible to sort clues. Tapping Key 1 will sort clues by the day they appear on, and the alphabetical order of the clues.</p>

<p>It is possible to filter clues. Tapping Key 2 repeatedly will filter clues using various criteria - such as the clue's grid direction, whether they have been started (i.e. contain letters), or whether they are unstarted.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="enteringanswers">Entering Answers</a></h1>
<p>Whilst navigating the clues list, you can hit Return or Enter to start entering an answer.</p>

<p>Type your guess in. Hit Enter to submit your guess. If you are unsure of all the letters, you may use the spacebar to leave a blank letter before proceeding to the next. For example, entering an answer such as T space space E D would enter letters into 
slots one, four and five, while leaving slots two and three blank (containing dots).</p>

<p>If you make a mistake when entering an answer, then the program will tell you the problem. You can hit Return or Enter to try again and enter another guess.</p>

<p>You can erase or delete a guess by hitting Backspace or Delete.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="validatinganswers">Validating Answers</a></h1>
<p>If the crossword you are solving contains a set of answers, then you may validate your clues by selecting the desired clue and pressing V. If there are any incorrect letters in the guess, they will be removed from the guess.</p>

<p>If a full set of answers for a puzzle is available to the program, then you can get an overall grade/mark for your guesses by pressing M.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="navigatinggrid">Navigating the Graphical Grid View</a></h1>
<p>Currently blind users cannot navigate the graphical grid. However, users with some sight can view the grid. It is possible to view the grid on its own by repeatedly pressing the apostrophe (') key.</p>

<p>The grid can be zoomed by scrolling your mouse wheel over the grid. If you do not have a scroll wheel, tapping the + (Plus) and - (Minus) keys can achieve the same effect.</p>

<p>You can move around the graphical grid view by left clicking and dragging your mouse across the view.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="printinganswers">Printing Crossword Answers</a></h1>
<p>To print your answers, press P. This will bring up a dialog which you must work with using your screen reader, in order to confirm that you wish to print. The printed document will include a list 
containing your answers and the Calendar Puzzles mailing address.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="emailinganswers">Emailing Crossword Answers</a></h1>
<p>To email your answers, press E. This will open up an email in your default mail program. It will be addressed to Calendar Puzzles and will contain a list that includes your answers.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="obtainingcrosswords">Obtaining Crosswords</a></h1>
<p>You can download completed crosswords and new crosswords from the CalendarPuzzles website. The website is accessible here: <br>

<a href="http://www.calendarpuzzles.co.uk/">http://www.calendarpuzzles.co.uk/</a>

</p>

<p>

Once you have downloaded a crossword file, you must move it into the Crosswords folder which is itself inside the Blind Crossword 3D folder. Once you have done this, you can open the load crossword dialog (reopen it if it was open to begin with)
in the program - you will find that the downloaded crossword file has appeared in the list.

<h1><a id="voices">Voices</a></h1>
<p>This software uses Microsoft SAPI computer-generated voices. Voices are not built into the game, and can be changed through the Windows Control Panel. </p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a></h1>
<p>Question #1 - Some words are pronounced incorrectly by the voice. How can I work around this?</p>
<p>Answer #1 - Unfortunately the quality of the pronunciation depends on the SAPI voice that is being used. 
You can press J to cycle between different types of reading. You can also press Keys I and O to read a clue you are having difficulty with word by word.</p>

<p>Question #2 - How do I change the program's voice?</p>
<p>Answer #2 - See the Voices section</p>

<p>Question #3 - I cannot do these difficult cryptic crosswords. How can I find easier ones?</p>
<p>Answer #3 - See the Obtaining Crosswords section</p>
