<h1><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Blind Crossword 3D is a computer program that enables blind and partially sighted crossword solvers to tackle three dimensional crossword puzzles.</p>

<p>The program is fully voiced - you should receive voiced feedback for any action you take in the program. At any point while using the program you can hit M to have the last voiced message read back to you.</p>

<h1><a id="loading">Loading Crosswords</a></h1>
<p>With the program running, you can hit L to open the list of crossword files. Use the up and down arrow keys to move through the list of files - the voice will read the name of the current file.
Hit Return or Enter to load the file. Once the file is loaded, you can move onto immediately solving it.
Alternatively, hit Escape to close the loading dialog, and continue to use the program.</p>

<p>You can hit L at any time to re-open the list of crossword files. Remember that if you want to save your progress on an existing open crossword, you must do so before loading a new crossword.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="saving">Saving Crosswords</a></h1>
<p>Hit S to save the currently open crossword. The crossword file is automatically saved with the title of the open crossword. If a crossword file of the same name already exists, then the crossword is saved
 using the crossword the title followed by an underscore followed by a number.</p>
 
<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="navigatingtable">Navigating the Clues Table</a></h1>
<p>You can use the arrow keys to navigate the clues table. The table has the following columns:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Date - CalendarPuzzles crosswords have a clue for each day, and so are numbered by date. Some puzzles even have solutions that are in alphabetical order of the date.</li>
	<li>Entry Name - Each clue entry name consists of the numbers and directions that the clue takes. Some clues snake around the grids, and so can take multiple numbers and directions!</li>
	<li>Guess - Your guess at the answer to the clue.</li>
	<li>Clue - The clue that you must solve.</li>
	<li>Solution Structure - The structure of the solution - the length of words in the answer, and the puncutation that comes in between those words.</li>
</ul>

<p>The voice will read out details of clues as you go navigate through the table. You can hit the W, E, R, T and Y to read different parts of the clue.</p>

<p>It is possible to sort clues. Tapping numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 will sort clues by the day they appear on, their word length, and the alphabetical order of the clues.</p>

<p>It is possible to filter clues. Tapping F repeatedly will filter clues by the direction, whether they have been started (i.e. contain letters), or whether they are unstarted.</p>

<h1><a id="enteringanswers">Entering Answers</a></h1>
<p>Whilst navigating the clues list, you can hit Return or Enter to open a dialog for entering your answers.</p>

<p>You can erase or delete a guess by hitting backspace.</p>

<p><a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a></p>

<h1><a id="validatinganswers">Validating Answers</a></h1>

<p>If a full set of answers are available to the program, then you can get an overall grade/mark for your guesses by pressing K.</p>

<h1><a id="navigatinggrid">Navigating the Graphical Grid View</a></h1>
<p>Currently blind users cannot navigate the graphical grid. However, users with some sight can view the grid by checking the box in the Options Menu, or by pressing TODO.</p>

<p>The grid can be zoomed by scrolling your mouse wheel over the grid. If you do not have a scroll wheel, tapping the TODO keys can achieve the same effect.</p>

<p>You can move around the graphical grid view by left clicking and dragging your mouse across the view. You can also drag grids around by clicking on them and moving your mouse.</p>
