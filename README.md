## Contributing

This project needs a maintainer. I developed it as a student with support and encouragement from the partially-sighted crossword setter Eric Westbrook and my university. I would be happy to return the favour to anyone interested in picking it up. If you are interested then contact me.

I have some notes on the [wiki](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/Blind-Crossword-3D/wiki) for how to Blind Crossword 3D better. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/Tw1ddle/Blind-Crossword-3D/issues) also contains plenty of proposals for improvements that were drafted out in collaboration with blind and partially-sighted users.
